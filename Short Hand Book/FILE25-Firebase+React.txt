            -> FIRE STORE DATABASE(This is a Service) is available, and this is a document based database. This is a popular database. We are using this database in our project.
            -> It will maintain the database in form of document structure.

            -> REAL TIME DATABASE(This is a Service) is available, and it looks like a fire store database. If you are update any data here, our app will be updated automatically.
            -> It will maintain the database in form of tree structure.

            -> STORE(This is a Service) is available, and it keeps the data like files, photos and videos which is uploaded by the user. It's like a cloud storage service.

HOW TO SET UP A REACT AND FIREBASE PROJECT?
    STEP 1: Create a new REACT application.
    
    STEP 2: Go to the FIREBASE PROJECT profile page, in that page you will see the title like "Get started by adding Firebase to your app"
    
    STEP 3: Below the title of your FIREBASE PROJECT profile page, you will see the ICONS like iOS, ANDROID and WEB.
    
    STEP 4: Clicking on the WEB icon, you will get a page which helps to connect with the web app.
    
    STEP 5: In the connection(Add Firebase to your web App) page, you will get a text box for to register your web app and my application name is "youtube-web-app" then click on the REGISTER APP" button.

    STEP 6: After you have registered you will get a cmd NPM I FIREBASE.

    STEP 7: Go back to the react app and install the cmd i.e NPM I FIREBASE

    STEP 8: After installing the cmd then, initialize Firebase and begin using the SDKs for the products that you'd like to use.
        -> So that create firebase.js file inside the SRC react app and copy the firebase SKD form the firebase connection page and paste it into the firebase.js file.
        -> This FIREBASE SDK helps you connect to the react app.
        -> After that click on the CONTINUE TO THE CONSOLE button.
        -> After click on the CONTINUE TO THE CONSOLE button you will get FIREBASE project profile page. 
        -> In that page, Below the firebase project name you will get 1 app option. It means one react application connected to the firebase project.
        -> If you click on the 1 app option you will get the web app name i.e "youtube-web-app".

    STEP 9: Verify the connection between the firebase project and the react app.
        -> Click on the REAL TIME DATABASE service option (It comes under BUILD left side menu in your firebase project profile page).
        -> Now, you are into the REAL TIME DATABASE service page and click on CREATE DATABASE button.
        -> You will get a dialog box with dropdown. In that dropdown select real time database location i.e UNITED STATES(us-central1). Default option and click on NEXT button.
        -> After that you will get a security rules option in the same dialog box.
        -> Click on the second radio button i.e for START IN TEST MODE because in that mode you will get a read and write capability. Where in the first options you won't and click on the ENABLE button.
        -> This helps you to create a real time database and you will get DATABASE URL also.

    STEP 10: You can copy the DATABASE URL from the console box and go to firebase.js file.

    STEP 11: In this file please update firebaseConfig object with databaseURL key and save it. So here I added firebase DATABASE url in the firebase.js file.

    STEP 12: Go to App.js file and 
        import { getDatabase } from "firebase/database";
        import { app } from "./firebase";
