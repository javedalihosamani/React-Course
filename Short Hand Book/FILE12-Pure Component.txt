PURE COMPONENTS
    -> Pure components are components that don't depend on external factors and always produce the same output for the same input.

    -> They are optimized for performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders by implementing shallow prop and state comparision.

    -> React's 'PureComponent' class is an optimized version of a class component that automatically performs shallow comparision of props and state.

    -> Using pure components can reduce rendering and improve the efficiency of your application.

    -> Pure components are particularly useful when dealing with large list or data sets that need to be updated frequently.
