REACT INSTALLATION
	1. We will learn to install REACT APP

	2. We will start with "create-react-app"

	3. Prerequisite
		a. Editor - Visula Studio Code
		b. Node - Installed
		c. npm - not installed

	4. npm install npm -g
	
	5. npm install create-react-app -g
	
	6. create-react-app --version

	7. Run the command "npx create-react-app <project-name>" to create the react app.

	8. npm start
		-> Starts the development server.

  	9. npm run build
    		-> Bundles the app into static files for production.

  	10. npm test
		-> Starts the test runner.

  	11. npm run eject
    		-> Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

	12. We suggest that you begin by typing:
		-> cd class1
		-> npm start

	Happy hacking!
