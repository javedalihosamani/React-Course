PROJECT CRUD
    - npm i --save react-router-dom bootstrap bootstrap-icons axios react-toastify

CREATE SERVER FOLDER UNDER REACT FOLDER
    - Open Server Folder using cmd.
    - npm i -g json-server
    - json-server --watch data.json --port 4000


For test case purpose we have declared readValue and submitHandler functions under Create.js file.

After that we remove readValue and submitHandler functions from Create.js file and used under FormValiadte.js file.

And also remove 
    const [contact, setContact] = useState({
        name: "",
        email: "",
        image: "",
        mobile: "",
        address: "",
    }); from Create.js file because we are returning from FormValiadte.js file. 

npm install --save lodash
